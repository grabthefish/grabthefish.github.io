The only reason you would be on this page is if you would want to know more about me, I wouldn't know why.

Anyway I'm Gunther, ~~known~~ unknown online as grabthefish.  
In my day job I'm a C#/.NET developer based in Belgium.

In my spare time I like to game, start and abandon projects, read books, ...  
In fact the name of this blog is inspired by a book.

The kind of content you could expect on this blog is... whatever I feel like posting about. That could range from software development to cooking to pet keeping. Sooo yeah a wide variety.
