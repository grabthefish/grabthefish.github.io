Project Zion is the (temporary) name for the little game I'm making using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.

Project Zion is inspired by some of my favourite franchises: Pokemon and Digimon.

The biggest challenges about this game will be the art and music, because I'm shit at both.

Below you can see a little video with what I already got, which at the moment isn't much.  
All there is to see is the new game creation, scene navigation, and dialogs, all with placeholder art.

With my track record I will probably not finish this project, so don't get your hopes up, not that you had any ðŸ˜€.
